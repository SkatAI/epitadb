# window functions applied to the trees table

The goal of this worksheet is to use window function on the treesdb ddatabase.

We work on the normalized version of the database treesdb_v03.

# Load the data


Connect to your local server (terminal + psq, or pgAdmin) to see if you have already created the treesdb_v03 database.

If not get the file from github and restore it into a new treesdb_v03 db.

## Load the dataset

You can download the data csv SQL file called ```treesdb_v03.01.sql.backup``` from the github repo.

- if you have already cloned the repo, refresh it with ```git pull origin master```
- if you haven't done so already: ```git clone git@github.com:SkatAI/epitadb.git```  and ```cd epitadb```
- or simply go to https://github.com/SkatAI/epitadb/tree/master/data and click right on the WorldHits.csv file to download it

## Restore the data

Create a new treesdb_v03

in the terminal, restore the database  with

```
pg_restore
```

change the owner if needded and the path to the downloaded file on your local.

# Info

we are not satisfied with the values in the stage column which are
```sql
select distinct(stage) from trees;
        stage
---------------------
 Adulte
 Jeune (arbre)
 Jeune (arbre)Adulte
 Mature
 [null]
(5 rows)
```

For each tree we want to calculate the max height for its type : genre, species, variety
and create a new stage column that depends on the ratio of height over max_height

1. calculate max(height) per genre, species, variety of tree
select max(height) for each tree given its (not null) genre, species and variety


select t.id, t.genre, t.species, t.variety, t.height,
max(height) over(partition by genre, species, variety) as max_height
from trees t
where t.genre is not null
and t.name is not null
and t.species is not null
and t.variety is not null
order by genre, name, species, variety
;

2. create a new_stage column
Then create a new text column called new_stage
then update new_stage with a query that implements the rule

if height < 0.25 * max_height then new_stage = 'young'
elif height < 0.50 * max_height then new_stage = 'young adult'
elif height < 0.75 * max_height then new_stage = 'adult'
elif height >= 0.75 * max_height then new_stage = 'mature'

3. is that new_stage in accordance with the original stage values ?


# II find outliers

we want to find crazy values for heights

All trees of the same type (genre, species, variety) should have the same height range

so we're going to order the trees by genre, species, varierty and height
for each tree find the height in the previous row
if the height of the tree is double the previous height
flag the tree as outlier



1. use the lag function with default value the avg tree height we just calculated
order trees by genre, species, variety (not null)
and get the last row height

for default,s pecify the height column and not a numerical value. This will set the previous height as the same height of the current row.

2. create a new column outlier as boolean default FALSE

write the query that sets the value of outlier
if height > 2 * prev_height then outlier is True

3. inspect the results,

- does the threshold at 2 make sense ?
