# Session 7

In this session we look at how postgreSQL handles the execution of queries and analyze the performance with EXPLAIN

EXPLAIN and query performance

# Last time

We saw

- normalizing the worldhits database
- window functions
- simple CTEs

# Today

- A lab on windows functions and CTEs (loosely graded)
- A look at how postgreSQL optimizes the performance
- using EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE to analyze the performance of queries
    - query optimizer,
    - cost functions
    - algorithms


# EOD

- you can write CTEs and use window functions in your queries
- you have a good idea of how the queries are executed in postgreSQL
