# Session 5 - September 30 - Query performance

In this session

- how PostgresSQL handles the execution of queries
- analyze a query performance with EXPLAIN

EXPLAIN and query performance

## Last time

We saw

- normalizing the WorldHits database
- window functions
- simple CTEs

## Today

- A lab on windows functions and CTEs (loosely graded)
- A look at how PostgresSQL optimizes queries
  - query optimizer,
  - cost functions,
  - algorithms
- `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to analyze the performance of queries

## forgot

We can use `row_number()` to delete dups see <https://blog.devgenius.io/10-postgresql-techniques-i-find-the-most-useful-1f98b5c7c38e>

## EOD

- you can write CTEs and use window functions in your queries
- you have a good idea of how the queries are executed in postgreSQL

## Before we start

- if you have already cloned the repo, cd into the project directory and refresh it with ```git pull origin master```
- if you haven't cloned the repo yet: ```git clone git@github.com:SkatAI/epitadb.git```  and ```cd epitadb```
- you can also download the repo as a zip file

## Resources

- a good post on PostgresSQL functions <https://blog.devgenius.io/10-postgresql-techniques-i-find-the-most-useful-1f98b5c7c38e>. A pdf version is on the [github](https://github.com/SkatAI/epitadb/blob/master/pdf/)
