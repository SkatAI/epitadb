# Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTE are a style of SQL queries whose goal is to simplifies queries by modularizing subqueries as temporary sets of results


They are essentially named subqueries aka **auxiliary statements** that can be referenced multiple times within a main query, making complex queries easier to read and manage.

CTEs are useful in scenarios where you want to:

* Break down complex queries into simpler, more manageable parts.
* Refer to a subquery multiple times within a single query.
* Improve query performance by structuring subqueries in a readable way.
* Handle recursive queries for hierarchical data (such as organizational charts or family trees).


A useful property of WITH queries is that they are normally evaluated only once per execution of the parent query, even if they are referred to more than once by the parent query or sibling WITH queries.

In two words : organize the subqueries

Same output but much cleaner code

- DRY
- final select is simple


Advantage of with clause
- more readable, easier debug
- no more temporary tables


The overall structure basically follows this schema

```sql
WITH subquery_name as (
    Some query
)
-- add other  WITH expressions as needed
-- ...
-- then select, update, insert, etc  from the named subqueries
SELECT *
FROM subquery_name
WHERE ... etc ...
```

## Load the data

Let's reload the WorldHits.csv data into a newly created worldhits database with the tracks table.

or we work on the normalized world hits

## Example

Let's start with a simple example where we want to count the number of tracks by artists.

The following query comes to mind
```sql
select artist, count(*) as track_count from tracks group by artist order by track_count desc limit 5;
```

But we can also extract the counting query into its own set of result and select from it.

```sql
WITH artist_track_count AS (
    SELECT artist, COUNT(*) as track_count
    FROM tracks
    GROUP BY artist
)
SELECT artist, track_count
FROM artist_track_count
ORDER BY track_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This will give the same result.

The advantage of using the CTE expression here is not yet clear.

Now let's say we want to look at the evolution of energy and danceability in tracks year after year to see if there's any trends worth noticing.

```sql
WITH yearly_averages AS (
    SELECT
        year,
        AVG(energy) AS avg_energy,
        AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
    FROM tracks
    GROUP BY year
)
SELECT
    year,
    avg_energy,
    avg_danceability,
    avg_energy - LAG(avg_energy) OVER (ORDER BY year desc) AS energy_change,
    avg_danceability - LAG(avg_danceability) OVER (ORDER BY year desc) AS danceability_change
FROM yearly_averages
ORDER BY year DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## More complex queries

> You're a music producer. a data driven music producer. You need to understand the trends and get insights
so you can decide which artists you want to work with and what types of songs you should produce.


> You're curious about how the energy and danceability of hit songs have changed over the years. This could help you understand if there's a trend towards more upbeat, danceable music or if the market is shifting towards more mellow tracks.

Let's take a look at danceability and energy of tracks over the years

```sql
SELECT
    year,
    AVG(energy) AS avg_energy,
    AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM tracks
GROUP BY year;
```

The you want to reuse these results to see how they evolve year after year. This is a job for the ```LAG()``` function!

So let's name the above query as ```yearly_stats``` :

```sql
-- name thedata gathering query as yearly_stats
WITH yearly_stats AS (
    SELECT
        year,
        AVG(energy) AS avg_energy,
        AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
    FROM tracks
    GROUP BY year
)
SELECT
    year,
    avg_energy,
    avg_danceability,
    avg_energy - LAG(avg_energy) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS energy_change,
    avg_danceability - LAG(avg_danceability) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS danceability_change
-- reuse the results from the named query
FROM yearly_stats
ORDER BY year DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Music style versatility per artist

> Necxt, you want to identify artists who are versatile in their musical style, as they might be good candidates for collaboration or signing. You decide to create a **versatility score** based on the variance (```STDDEV()```) in some of their tracks' features.

The score is defined as the mean of (energy_std + danceability_std + acousticness_std + instrumentalness_std)

Let's first get the stats. We only keep the artists with more than 4 tracks so that the standard deviation makes sense.


```sql
-- get the main sets of results
SELECT
    artist,
    COUNT(*) AS track_count,
    ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(energy) AS numeric), 2) AS energy_std,
    ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(danceability) AS numeric), 2) AS danceability_std,
    ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(acousticness) AS numeric), 2) AS acousticness_std,
    ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(instrumentalness) AS numeric), 2) AS instrumentalness_std
FROM tracks
GROUP BY artist
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4;
```


Then calculate the versatility_score by resuing the above query as a named subquery

```sql
WITH artist_stats AS (
    SELECT
        artist,
        COUNT(*) AS track_count,
        ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(energy) AS numeric), 2) AS energy_std,
        ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(danceability) AS numeric), 2) AS danceability_std,
        ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(acousticness) AS numeric), 2) AS acousticness_std,
        ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(instrumentalness) AS numeric), 2) AS instrumentalness_std
    FROM tracks
    GROUP BY artist
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4
)
SELECT
    artist,
    track_count,
    ROUND(
        CAST( (energy_std + danceability_std + acousticness_std + instrumentalness_std) AS numeric), 2) AS versatility_score
FROM artist_stats;
```

And finally we order by the ```versatility_score``` by re-using that last query as a named query ```artist_versatility```

The final total query is

```sql
WITH artist_stats AS (
    SELECT
        artist,
        COUNT(*) AS track_count,
        ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(energy) AS numeric), 2) AS energy_std,
        ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(danceability) AS numeric), 2) AS danceability_std,
        ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(acousticness) AS numeric), 2) AS acousticness_std,
        ROUND(CAST(STDDEV(instrumentalness) AS numeric), 2) AS instrumentalness_std
    FROM tracks
    GROUP BY artist
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
),
artist_versatility AS (
    SELECT
        artist,
        track_count,
        ROUND(CAST( (energy_std + danceability_std + acousticness_std + instrumentalness_std) AS numeric), 2) AS versatility_score
    FROM artist_stats
)
SELECT
    artist,
    track_count,
    versatility_score
FROM artist_versatility
ORDER BY versatility_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Imagine what you can do now with CTEs and windows functions !!!


### What does this query do ?

```sql
WITH artist_yearly_stats AS (
    SELECT
        artist,
        year,
        AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity,
        COUNT(*) AS track_count
    FROM tracks
    -- WHERE year >= 2010
    GROUP BY artist, year
),
artist_growth AS (
    SELECT
        artist,
        SUM(track_count) AS total_tracks,
        MIN(avg_popularity) AS min_popularity,
        MAX(avg_popularity) AS max_popularity,
        MAX(avg_popularity) - MIN(avg_popularity) AS popularity_growth
    FROM artist_yearly_stats
    GROUP BY artist
    HAVING SUM(track_count) >= 3 AND COUNT(DISTINCT year) >= 2
)
SELECT
    artist,
    total_tracks,
    min_popularity,
    max_popularity,
    popularity_growth
FROM artist_growth
-- WHERE max_popularity > 60
ORDER BY popularity_growth DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

# More WITH AS

We've seen the simple WITH ... AS clause.

> A useful property of WITH queries is that they are normally evaluated only once per execution of the parent query, even if they are referred to more than once by the parent query or sibling WITH queries.

> Thus, *expensive calculations* that are needed in multiple places can be placed within a WITH query to avoid redundant work.

The downside is that

>  The multiply-referenced WITH query will be evaluated as written, without suppression of rows that the parent query might discard afterwards.


The query optimizer (next week) will sometimes choose to store the results of the WITH query ina  temporary table, ... or not.

There are cases where we want to enforce storing the results of the WITH query into a temp table.
We can do that ba adding ```MATERIALIZED``` or ```NOT MATERIALIZED``` to the WITH clause:

```sql
WITH w AS (NOT) MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT * FROM big_table
)
SELECT * FROM w AS w1 JOIN w AS w2 ON w1.key = w2.ref
WHERE w2.key = 123;
```

### Recursive


Using ```RECURSIVE```, a WITH query can refer to its own output. A very simple example is this query to sum the integers from 1 through 100:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
    VALUES (1)
  UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1 FROM t WHERE n < 100
)
SELECT sum(n) FROM t;
```

---------
For each year,
- find the artist with the highest average track popularity,
- but only consider artists who have released at least 3 tracks in that year.
- Also, include the artist's most popular track for that year and its popularity score.

Let's break it down


first calculate for each artist, the year, number of tracks, average and max popularity
and keep only the artists with at least 3 tracks for that year

```sql
SELECT
    year,
    artist,
    COUNT(*) as track_count,
    ROUND(AVG(popularity),1) as avg_popularity,
    MAX(popularity) as max_popularity
FROM tracks
GROUP BY year, artist
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

Then we want all these elements and give then a row number per year ordered by avg_popularity
So we reuse the above query as a named query in a WITH statement and select from it:

Note we don;t need the ```track count``` in the main query since we have already filtered on it.

```sql
WITH artist_year_stats AS (
    -- subquery: get the basic elements from tracks and filter
    SELECT
        year,
        artist,
        COUNT(*) as track_count,
        ROUND(AVG(popularity),1) as avg_popularity,
        MAX(popularity) as max_popularity
    FROM tracks
    GROUP BY year, artist
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
)
-- main query: reuse the expected columns from the named subquery and calculate the ranks / row numbers
SELECT
    year,
    artist,
    avg_popularity,
    max_popularity,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY year ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC) as rank
FROM artist_year_stats;
```

Then
```sql
SELECT
    t.year,
    t.artist,
    t.track,
    t.popularity,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY t.year, t.artist ORDER BY t.popularity DESC) as track_rank
FROM tracks t
JOIN ranked_artists ra ON t.year = ra.year AND t.artist = ra.artist AND w.popularity = ra.max_popularity
WHERE ra.rank = 1
```
