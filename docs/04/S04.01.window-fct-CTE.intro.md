# Session 4

## Last time

We saw

- OLAP vs OLTP databases
- ERD and how to generate it in pgAdmin, also the SQL that creates the schema
- insertion, update and deletion anomalies
- the problem with NULL values and why you want to avoid them
- normalization
- normal forms

And we started working on the normalization of the trees table

Taking the column ```domain``` as example, the process has the following steps

- first make sure that the column is a good candidate for normalization

```domain``` is a categorical column, with null values, many uniques

and then

- create ```domains``` table
- import UNIQUE and NOT NULL domain values from trees to domains. Values are sorted alphabetically
- add a ```domain_id``` key in the trees table
- reconcile the foreign key with the primary key: ```trees.domain_id``` with the ```domain.id```
- add a constraint on that key so that it is a foreign key in the trees table referencing the domains table
- check that all trees records have a valid ```domain_id```
- drop the ```domain``` column in trees


## Today


### First a PC and Mac:

    - where is postgres installed?
    - how to add postgres to the PATH
    - starting, stopping and monitoring postgres with brew or pg_ctl
    - location of .psqlrc, pg_hba, postgresql.conf
    - create .pgpass to avoid having to type your password each time

### Practice :

Loosely graded.

- psql or pgAdmin on your new server
- new dataset : spotify songs : 366 records. csv file. no need to USE pgAdmin restore or pg_restore.
- Your task is to normalize the artist column following the process above

- If you're done before the break (11h30), read:
    - how to setup psqlrc: https://www.crunchydata.com/postgres-tips
    - or choose something to read in the documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql.html


### Window functions and CTEs

We'll use the WorldHits dataset to learn about:

- window functions : ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), ... , OVER(Partition by ...)
- Common Table Expressions : WITH ... AS (sql) SELECT ....

## EOD:

- everybody is on board : restoring, psql and postgresql running
- you can normalize a column from a table
- you can write queries using window function and CTEs
