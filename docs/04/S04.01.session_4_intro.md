# Session 4

## Last time

We saw

- OLAP vs OLTP databases
- ERD and how to generate it in pgAdmin, also the SQL that creates the schema
- insertion, update and deletion anomalies
- the problem with NULL values and why you want to avoid them
- normalization
- normal forms

And we started working on the normalization of the trees table

Taking the column domain as example, the process has the following steps

- make sure the column is a good candidate to have its own table

domain is a categorical column, with null values, many uniques
and

- create domains table
- import UNIQUE and NOT NULL domain values from trees to domains. Values are sorted alphabetically
- add a domain_id key in the trees table
- reconcile the foreign key with the primary key: tree.domain_id with the domain.id
- add a constraint on that key so that it is a foreign key in the trees table referencing the domains table
- check that all trees records have a valid domain_id
- drop the domain column in trees


## Today


- But first a PC and Mac

    - where is postgres installed?
    - how to add postgres to the PATH
    - starting, stopping and monitoring postgres with brew or pg_ctl



- practice :
    - psql or pgAdmin on your new server
    - new dataset : spotify songs : 366 records. dump is plain sql. no need to restore. just copy paste in Query window.
    - normalize the artist

When you're done read

- setup psqlrc or equivalent

https://www.crunchydata.com/postgres-tips

- some part of the documentation

EOD
- everybody is on board
- everybody can normalize a column from a table


if we have time we start with windows functions and CTEs
