# quiz on Scans

This set of questions relates to the results of the EXPLAIN query on simple queries.

1. what elements are used by the query optimizer to compute teh cost function

- CPU cycles and I/O accesses
- query time
- user satisfaction

2. what is a sequential scan

in the query
```sql
select * from trees;
```
The EXPLAIN diagram uses a sequential scan

What is a sequential scan ?

- the algo goes over all the table rows one by one
- the algo goes over all the table rows in bulk of 8192 blocks
- the algo goes over all the table columns one by one and then rows by rows

3. difference between EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE

- same. EX AN outputs out more data like the temperature of the query
- ANALYZE actually executes the query
- ANALZYE gets real data on the data disctribution EXPLAIN a=lone uses default stats

4. how does the query planner chooses the algorithms to execute the query

- the nature of the tables and the data
- the type of filter (WHERE) operator : =, <, between, like '%string' etc
- the data types of the columns involved in the filters
- the number of rows of the table, the subqueries etc
- limit, order by
- full text search is a topic by itself
- the performance of the machine
- all of the above

5. compare the 2 queries. why ahs the cost gone up when we add a filter

```sql
epita@airdb=> explain select * from passenger;
                              QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on passenger  (cost=0.00..334838.55 rows=16311855 width=47)
(1 row)
```
so we have
* cost: 334,838
* rows: 16,311,855


and
```sql
epita@airdb=> explain select * from passenger where age > 68;
                                   QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on passenger  (cost=0.00..375618.19 rows=3613778 width=47)
   Filter: (age > 18)
(5 rows)
```
so we have
* cost: 375,618
* rows: 3,613,778

In the second query the cost has gone up although less rows are returned.

Why ?

- Seq Scan still has to go over all the 16.3M passenger rows and has to check the condition for each row
- Older people travel less so the algorrithm only finds matching records at the end of the table
- Intermediate rresults have to be stored before the filter can be applied. This extra I/O adds to the cost function

### Index and Bitmap scans

the passenger table has a id primary key

Explain the difference between Index Scan and Index Heap scan in the 2 examples

```sql
 explain select * from passenger where passenger_id = 8888;
                                   QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using passenger_pkey on passenger  (cost=0.43..8.45 rows=1 width=47)
   Index Cond: (passenger_id = 8888)
(2 rows)
```

and

```sql
explain select * from passenger where passenger_id < 8888;
                                    QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on passenger  (cost=184.03..31558.41 rows=9754 width=47)
   Recheck Cond: (passenger_id < 8888)
   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on passenger_pkey  (cost=0.00..181.59 rows=9754 width=0)
         Index Cond: (passenger_id < 8888)
```

Which if the following statement is true

6. Index Scans

- Used when: Fetching a small number of rows based on an index condition.
- uses the index to find the location of rows matching the condition.
- Efficient for reading large portions of a table, but can be slow for selective queries on large tables.
- Reads all rows in the table sequentially, one after another.

7. Bitmap Heap Scans

- Used when: Fetching a moderate number of rows based on an index condition.
-  More efficient than Index Scan when retrieving a larger number of rows, but still selective enough not to warrant a full Sequential Scan.
- Very efficient for retrieving a small number of rows, especially with highly selective conditions.
- Uses an index to create the bitmap, then accesses the table.


8. order of operations

In the following queryr plan

```sql
explain select * from passenger order by random() limit 50;
                                    QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=917486.28..917486.41 rows=50 width=55)
   ->  Sort  (cost=917486.28..958265.92 rows=16311855 width=55)
         Sort Key: (random())
         ->  Seq Scan on passenger  (cost=0.00..375618.19 rows=16311855 width=55)
 JIT:
   Functions: 3
   Options: Inlining true, Optimization true, Expressions true, Deforming true
(7 rows)
```

what is the order of operations ?

- bottom to top: seq scan on the whole table, then sort by random, then limit to 50 rows
- top to bottom: limit to 50 rows than sorrting by random and finally scanning on the rows
- does not matter. each step can be done independantly
