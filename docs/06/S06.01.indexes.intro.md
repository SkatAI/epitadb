# Session 6

# Last time

We saw

- in a relational database everything (mostly) is a relation
- how the query optimizer works
- the cost function the planner tries to minimmize
- the structure of an explain plan
- difference between EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- how to EXPLAIN ANALYZE update, insert and delete queries
- several types of algorithms for scanning data

# Today

We start by a small quizz on the algorithms we've seen so far

and then go further into indexing


# EOD

You will be able to know when to add an index to speed up a slow query
