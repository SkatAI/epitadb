```

This SQL script creates three tables: `energy_sources`, `countries`, and `production_entities`. It then populates them with data, including 1 million rows in the main `production_entities` table.

Now, let's create some example queries that students can use to explore the benefits of indexing. I'll provide these queries along with instructions on how to use them to compare query performance with and without indexes.

# Indexing Exercises for PostgreSQL

## Exercise 1: Equality Condition with Hash Index vs. B-tree Index

1. Run the following query and use EXPLAIN to analyze its performance:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM production_entities
WHERE energy_source_id = 1;
```

2. Create a Hash index on the `energy_source_id` column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_hash_energy_source_id ON production_entities USING HASH (energy_source_id);
```

3. Run the EXPLAIN ANALYZE query again and compare the results.

4. Drop the Hash index:

```sql
DROP INDEX idx_hash_energy_source_id;
```

5. Create a B-tree index on the `energy_source_id` column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_btree_energy_source_id ON production_entities USING BTREE (energy_source_id);
```

6. Run the EXPLAIN ANALYZE query a third time and compare the results.

## Exercise 2: Range Condition with B-tree Index

1. Run the following query and use EXPLAIN to analyze its performance:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM production_entities
WHERE capacity_mw BETWEEN 100 AND 500;
```

2. Create a B-tree index on the `capacity_mw` column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_btree_capacity_mw ON production_entities USING BTREE (capacity_mw);
```

3. Run the EXPLAIN ANALYZE query again and compare the results.

3.2 reduce the range
drop the indedx
explain analyze
create indx
EXPLAIN analyze

the boost is higher

## Exercise 3: Multi-column Index

1. Run the following query and use EXPLAIN to analyze its performance:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM production_entities
WHERE country_id = 1 AND built_date > '2010-01-01';
```

2. Create a multi-column B-tree index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_btree_country_built_date ON production_entities USING BTREE (country_id, built_date);
```

3. Run the EXPLAIN ANALYZE query again and compare the results.

## Exercise 4: Function-based Index

1. Run the following query and use EXPLAIN to analyze its performance:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM production_entities
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM built_date) = 2015;
```

2. Create a function-based index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_btree_built_year ON production_entities USING BTREE (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM built_date));
```

3. Run the EXPLAIN ANALYZE query again and compare the results.

For each exercise, students should:

1. Note the execution time and plan cost before creating the index.
2. Create the specified index.
3. Run the query again and note the new execution time and plan cost.
4. Compare the results and observe how the index affects the query performance.
5. Pay attention to whether the planner decides to use the index or not, and why.

Encourage students to experiment with different query conditions and index types to gain a deeper understanding of how indexing affects query performance in PostgreSQL.

These exercises will help students understand the benefits of creating hash and B-tree indexes on database tables and columns in PostgreSQL. They'll be able to compare the performance of queries with and without indexes, and see how different types of indexes can affect query execution plans.

Here are some key points for the students to keep in mind:

1. Hash indexes are generally best for equality conditions, while B-tree indexes are versatile and can handle equality, range, and sorting operations.

2. The effectiveness of an index depends on various factors, including the selectivity of the query (i.e., how many rows it's expected to return relative to the total number of rows in the table).

3. Sometimes, the query planner might choose not to use an index if it determines that a sequential scan would be faster (e.g., when returning a large portion of the table).

4. Multi-column indexes can be particularly useful for queries that filter on multiple columns simultaneously.

5. Function-based indexes can improve performance for queries that use functions or expressions in their WHERE clauses.

To run these exercises, students should:

1. Execute the SQL script to create and populate the database on their local PostgreSQL instances.
2. Copy and paste each query from the exercises into their PostgreSQL client.
3. Analyze the EXPLAIN output before and after creating each index.
4. Document their findings and observations about how the indexes affect query performance.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this worksheet or provide additional exercises?

## Exercise 5: HASH Index on JOIN Condition

For this exercise, we'll create a new table to demonstrate the benefits of a HASH index on a JOIN condition. First, let's create and populate a new table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE energy_production_daily (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    production_entity_id INTEGER REFERENCES production_entities(id),
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    energy_produced_mwh NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

-- Function to generate daily energy production data
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_daily_production(num_days INTEGER)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    i INTEGER;
    v_production_entity_id INTEGER;
    v_date DATE;
    v_energy_produced_mwh NUMERIC(10, 2);
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1..num_days LOOP
        -- Select a random production entity
        SELECT id INTO v_production_entity_id
        FROM production_entities
        ORDER BY RANDOM()
        LIMIT 1;

        -- Generate a random date within the last year
        v_date := CURRENT_DATE - (random() * 365)::INTEGER;

        -- Generate random energy production (between 0 and the entity's capacity)
        SELECT random() * capacity_mw * 24 INTO v_energy_produced_mwh
        FROM production_entities
        WHERE id = v_production_entity_id;

        -- Insert the generated data
        INSERT INTO energy_production_daily (production_entity_id, date, energy_produced_mwh)
        VALUES (v_production_entity_id, v_date, v_energy_produced_mwh);
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Generate 5 million rows of daily production data
SELECT generate_daily_production(5000000);
```

Now, let's create an exercise to show the benefits of a HASH index on the JOIN condition:

1. Run the following query and use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to analyze its performance:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT pe.entity_name, epd.date, epd.energy_produced_mwh
FROM energy_production_daily epd
JOIN production_entities pe ON epd.production_entity_id = pe.id
WHERE epd.date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

2. Create a HASH index on the `production_entity_id` column in the `energy_production_daily` table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_hash_production_entity_id ON energy_production_daily USING HASH (production_entity_id);
```

3. Run the EXPLAIN ANALYZE query again and compare the results.

4. Optionally, create a B-tree index on the `date` column to further improve performance:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_btree_date ON energy_production_daily USING BTREE (date);
```

5. Run the EXPLAIN ANALYZE query a third time and compare the results.

For this exercise, students should:

1. Note the execution time and plan cost before creating any indexes.
2. Create the HASH index on the `production_entity_id` column.
3. Run the query again and note the new execution time and plan cost.
4. Create the B-tree index on the `date` column.
5. Run the query a third time and note the execution time and plan cost.
6. Compare all three results and observe how the indexes affect the query performance.

Key points for students to consider:

1. HASH indexes can significantly improve the performance of equality JOIN conditions.
2. The combination of a HASH index on the JOIN condition and a B-tree index on the WHERE clause can lead to even better performance.
3. Observe how the query planner changes its strategy when different indexes are available.
4. Note that the effectiveness of indexes can vary depending on the data distribution and query selectivity.

Encourage students to experiment with different JOIN conditions and table sizes to gain a deeper understanding of how HASH indexes can improve JOIN performance in PostgreSQL.
