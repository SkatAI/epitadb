# Transactions

A database transaction is a single logical unit of work that contains one or more database operations (read/write). It must be executed completely (committed) or not at all (rolled back), ensuring data consistency even in case of system failure. In other words - all or nothing.

This "all or nothing" property makes transactions the fundamental building block for maintaining data integrity in databases.

## ACID properties:

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

These properties ensure that database transactions are processed reliably.

- **Atomicity** guarantees that all operations in a transaction are completed or none are. Either the entire transaction takes place at once or doesnâ€™t happen at all.


Let's illustrate this with a transaction that updates the health status of a group of trees:

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Update health status for trees in a specific area
UPDATE paris_trees
SET health_status = 'Needs Attention'
WHERE district = '7th Arrondissement' AND last_inspection_date < '2023-01-01';

-- Insert a log entry
INSERT INTO maintenance_log (action, date, details)
VALUES ('Mass health status update', CURRENT_DATE, '7th Arrondissement trees flagged for inspection');

COMMIT;

```

This transaction demonstrates ACID properties:

- Atomicity: Both the update and insert will succeed or fail together.
- Consistency: The database moves from one valid state (before the update) to another (after the update).
- Isolation: Other transactions won't see the partial results until this transaction is committed.
- Durability: Once committed, these changes will persist even if there's a system failure.



- **Consistency** ensures the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.  Integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation** keeps concurrent transactions separate until they're completed. Multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency of the database state.
- **Durability** guarantees that completed transactions persist, even in case of system failures. Once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs.



## Transaction control commands:

SQL commands used to manage transactions.

- BEGIN starts a new transaction block.
- COMMIT saves all changes made in the transaction to the database.
- ROLLBACK undoes all changes made in the transaction, reverting the database to its state before the transaction began.

Here's an example showing the use of BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK:

```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Insert a new tree
INSERT INTO paris_trees (tree_id, species, height, district)
VALUES (20001, 'Tilia platyphyllos', 12.5, '15th Arrondissement');

-- Update heights of existing trees
UPDATE paris_trees
SET height = height + 0.5
WHERE district = '15th Arrondissement'
AND height < 10;

-- If you want to cancel these changes:
ROLLBACK;

-- If you want to save these changes:
COMMIT;
```

Note: You would use either **ROLLBACK** or **COMMIT**, not both. I showed both here just for illustration purposes. In practice, you'd choose one based on whether you want to keep or discard the changes made within the transaction.

You would use ROLLBACK in a PL/pgSQL function so that the rollback occurs if something is not as expected.

```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Update a tree's species
UPDATE paris_trees
SET species = 'Quercus robur'
WHERE tree_id = 67890;

-- Check the number of affected rows
DO $$
DECLARE
    rows_updated INT;
BEGIN
    GET DIAGNOSTICS rows_updated = ROW_COUNT; -- Store the number of affected rows
    IF rows_updated = 0 THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Tree not found. Rolling back transaction.';
        ROLLBACK;
    END IF;
END $$;

-- If the update was successful, commit the transaction
COMMIT;

```


## Savepoints and partial rollbacks:

Savepoints allow you to create specific points within a transaction that you can roll back to without aborting the entire transaction. This is useful for handling errors or implementing complex transaction logic where you might want to undo part of a transaction but keep other parts.

Let's demonstrate savepoints with a scenario of updating multiple trees:

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Update the height of the first tree
UPDATE paris_trees SET height = 15.5 WHERE tree_id = 10001;
SAVEPOINT update_tree_1;

-- Update the height of the second tree
UPDATE paris_trees SET height = 18.2 WHERE tree_id = 10002;
SAVEPOINT update_tree_2;

-- Oops, we made a mistake on the second tree. Let's roll back to after the first update
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT update_tree_1;

-- Now let's try updating the second tree again
UPDATE paris_trees SET height = 17.8 WHERE tree_id = 10002;

-- Everything looks good, let's commit the transaction
COMMIT;

```

This example demonstrates how to use **savepoints** to create "checkpoints" within a transaction.

If a part of the transaction needs to be undone, you can roll back to a specific savepoint without discarding the entire transaction.

## Deadlock detection and prevention:

**Deadlocks** occur when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks, resulting in a circular dependency. PostgreSQL automatically detects deadlocks and resolves them by aborting one of the transactions.

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-DEADLOCKS

## Concurrency

- **Transaction isolation levels**: These define how and when changes made by one transaction become visible to other concurrent transactions. PostgreSQL supports four isolation levels: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable. Each level provides different trade-offs between consistency and performance.

- **Two-phase commit (2PC)**: This is a protocol for ensuring that a transaction is committed in all involved databases or none at all. It's particularly important in **distributed database systems**. The process involves a prepare phase and a commit phase, ensuring **atomicity** across multiple databases or servers.

- **Handling concurrent transactions**: This involves managing multiple transactions that are executing simultaneously. It includes understanding how to prevent conflicts, handle lock contention, and ensure data consistency when multiple users or processes are accessing the database at the same time.
