# Session 9: outstanding topics

## So far

We covered quite a lot already but PostgreSQL is a complex beast and there are a few things you should be aware of still.

- loading databases, and simple things,
- normalization
- CTEs and window functions
- Optimizing queries with EXPLAIN
- Indexes: B-tree and Has Indexes
- Views and functions
- PL/pgSQL

## What we did not cover yet and we must do so

There are quite a few things we still need to cover.

- Transactions and ACID
- special function use cases: Triggers and procedures
- Access and configuration files
- Roles and users
- Demo big query

## Today

For the first half we'll fast track on these topics.
And then we can work on the BAN addresses API workshop.

## EOD

You can confidently design and optimize and exploit a semi-large database.
