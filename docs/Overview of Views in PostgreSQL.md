### Overview of Views in PostgreSQL

A **view** in PostgreSQL is a virtual table that is created by a `SELECT` query. It acts as a stored query that users can treat like a regular table, allowing for the abstraction and simplification of complex queries.

#### Key Characteristics:

1. **Virtual Table**: 
   - A view does not store data itself. Instead, it presents data from one or more tables based on the query used to define it. 
   - When you query a view, PostgreSQL executes the underlying `SELECT` statement and returns the result set as if it were a table.

2. **Simplicity**:
   - Views simplify complex queries by encapsulating them into a single, reusable entity. Users can select from a view without needing to know the underlying table structure or join conditions.

3. **Security**:
   - Views can restrict access to specific data. For instance, you can create a view that only exposes certain columns of a table, thereby limiting what data users can see.
   - PostgreSQL also supports **updatable views**, allowing users to perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations on a view, which then affect the underlying tables.

4. **Data Abstraction**:
   - Views provide a layer of abstraction over the physical schema. This can be useful if the underlying schema changes, as you can update the view without affecting user queries.

5. **Maintenance**:
   - Views can be updated or dropped without affecting the underlying tables. However, changing the structure of underlying tables might require updating the associated views.

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Since views are not stored with the data but are generated on the fly, complex views with multiple joins or subqueries can lead to performance issues, especially with large datasets.

7. **Materialized Views**:
   - PostgreSQL also supports **materialized views**, which store the result of the `SELECT` query physically on disk. This can improve performance for complex queries but requires manual or scheduled refreshing to keep the data up to date.

#### Basic Example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT customer_id, name, email
FROM customers
WHERE status = 'active';
```

In this example, `active_customers` is a view that shows only the active customers from the `customers` table. Users can query `active_customers` just like a table.

#### Usage:

- **Querying a View**: 
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM active_customers;
  ```
- **Updating a View** (if updatable):
  ```sql
  UPDATE active_customers SET status = 'inactive' WHERE customer_id = 1;
  ```

Views in PostgreSQL are powerful tools for data management, providing simplicity, security, and flexibility in how data is presented and accessed.
