# Project

The last session will be a 3h hands-on lab where you will be asked to apply the techniques we have seen in the course on a brand new dataset.

For instance, this may include:

- load the original csv file or restore a SQL dump
- add keys, change col types if neeed
- normalize some of the columns
- write queries using CTEs or window functions
- explain the results of the EXPLAIN command on specific queries
- add indexes to speed up some queries
- create views and write functions
- transactions
- creating roles and troubleshooting access

# Grading

A mix of:

- the grades of the weekly hands on lab (keeping the 2 /3 best grades only)
- the grade for the final project

You can pair up for all the labs but no more than 2 persons per team.
