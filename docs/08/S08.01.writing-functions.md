## Context

In the last session we saw how to write SQL functions and PL/pgSQL functions.

To start today's class I'd like to go over

- General best practice to write functions
- Specifics of PL/pgSQL functions

# Functions that scale

> How would you define what is a well written function ?

We can look at 2 aspects to begin with

- proper naming
- single responsibility principle


## Naming

A good way to name function is to have its name that starts with an action verb followed by the name of the object it acts upon.

For instance

- retrieve_use_record
- count_hits
- convert_rows_to_json


Some additional best practices for naming functions:

- **Be specific**: Names should precisely describe the function's task.
- Use **consistent** terminology: Stick to a specific style or terminology throughout your codebase.
- **Avoid abbreviations**: Write full words to keep things clear unless abbreviations are universally understood in your team or project.
- **Length**: Aim for names that are long enough to be descriptive but not overly verbose.


### Single responsibility principle

This is super important

- it facilitates comprehension
- it helps with writing automated tests
- it greatly reduces bugs and erratic behaviors


The SRP comes down to :

> **A function has one job and one job only !**

Don't

- extract data and transform it,
- log in a user and send an email,
- launch the video, update views counts, and generate subtitles,

 ... in the same function

## How to write a good prompt ?

Which leads me to good prompting techniques

Working with an LLM can be frustrating and depressing. Not because the answers are wrong (might be when it comes to coding) but because if done without effort, lazily, it kills the pleasure we get from creative work.

Instead of simply asking a questions and copy pasting the answer, you need to really engage with the LLM.

Difference between

from ;
> What are best practices for naming functions?

to

> I'm looking into best practices to name a function in a high level programming language  (python, ... or even PL/pgSQL).

> My advice would be
> - the function name starts with a verb followed by the name of the object it acts upon.

> What do you think ?

In short

- give context
- ask for review, opinion or feedback
- reword what you understood


What are your techniques for writing efficient prompts ?

## PL/pgSQL functions

### The structure of a PL/pgSQL function

The following sections are taken from https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-plpgsql/plpgsql-block-structure/. Please refer to this site for further details.


#### Blocks

PL/pgSQL blocks have a structure that includes a **declaration section** (optional) and an **execution section** (mandatory). Inside a block, variables are declared first, followed by the logic executed. Blocks can be nested, with labels for referencing.

Example:

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    total_sales NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(amount) INTO total_sales FROM sales;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Total Sales: %', total_sales;
END $$;
```

Here, `total_sales` is declared, a query calculates the total sales, and the result is displayed using `RAISE NOTICE`.

#### Variables

In PL/pgSQL, variables are declared in the **declaration section** of a block and hold temporary data. You can initialize them upon declaration using `:=` or by copying another variable's data type using `%TYPE`. Variables can have different scopes depending on where they're declared.

Example:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_discount()
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
DECLARE
    total_sales NUMERIC := 0;
    discount NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(amount) INTO total_sales FROM sales;
    discount := total_sales * 0.1;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Total Sales: %, Discount: %', total_sales, discount;
    RETURN discount;
END $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This declares and initializes variables and uses them in calculations.

#### Select INTO

In PL/pgSQL, the `SELECT INTO` statement assigns the result of a query to variables. This is useful when retrieving a single value or multiple columns into variables within a function. You can use `SELECT INTO` to process values and perform further calculations or return the result.

**Example**: Total Play Count for a Spotify Artist

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_artist_play_count(artist_name TEXT)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
DECLARE
    total_plays NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(play_count) INTO total_plays
    FROM tracks
    WHERE artist = artist_name;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Total plays for %: %', artist_name, total_plays;
    RETURN total_plays;
END $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This function calculates the total play count for an artist in the Spotify database by selecting the sum of `play_count` for all tracks associated with the given artist name.

#### RECORD Types

In PL/pgSQL, **record types** allow you to handle rows of data without needing to define a fixed structure. A record can hold a row from any table or query, and its fields are dynamically assigned at runtime. You can use `%ROWTYPE` to copy the structure of a table.

This function retrieves the top artist by play count from a Spotify-like database.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_top_artist()
RETURNS RECORD AS $$
DECLARE
    artist_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) as plays INTO artist_record
    FROM spotify_tracks
    GROUP BY artist_name
    ORDER BY plays DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    RETURN artist_record;
END $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```


#### Declaring constant

To define a constant in PL/pgSQL, you use the following syntax:

```sql
constant_name constant data_type = expression;
```

#### RAISING NOTICE and Exceptions

In PL/pgSQL, errors and messages are handled using `RAISE` to display notices, warnings, or errors. You can also use error-handling blocks with `EXCEPTION`. Messages provide valuable debugging information.

Here’s a function example related to a Spotify-like database:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_streaming_revenue(artist_id INT)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
DECLARE
    total_revenue NUMERIC := 0;
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        SELECT SUM(streams * revenue_per_stream) INTO total_revenue
        FROM tracks WHERE artist = artist_id;

        IF total_revenue IS NULL THEN
            RAISE NOTICE 'No streams found for artist ID: %', artist_id;
            RETURN 0;
        ELSE
            RAISE NOTICE 'Total Revenue for Artist ID %: %', artist_id, total_revenue;
            RETURN total_revenue;
        END IF;

    EXCEPTION
        WHEN OTHERS THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION 'Error calculating revenue for artist ID %', artist_id;
    END;
END $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This function
- calculates an artist’s total streaming revenue and raises a message if no streams are found.
- uses an error handler that raises an exception if any unforeseen error occurs during the calculation process.

#### If Then Else

In PL/pgSQL, `IF-THEN-ELSE` statements allow conditional logic. You can check conditions and perform different actions depending on the result.

Example:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_artist_popularity(artist_id INT)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
    popularity INT;
BEGIN
    SELECT popularity INTO popularity FROM artists WHERE id = artist_id;

    IF popularity > 80 THEN
        RETURN 'Very Popular';
    ELSIF popularity > 50 THEN
        RETURN 'Moderately Popular';
    ELSE
        RETURN 'Less Popular';
    END IF;
END $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This function returns an artist's popularity description based on their popularity score.

#### Looping

In PL/pgSQL, loops allow you to repeat actions multiple times. You can use basic loops, `FOR`, `WHILE`, and `EXIT` to control the flow.

Example:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_top_streams(p_artist_id INT)
RETURNS INT AS $$
DECLARE
    v_total_streams INT := 0;
    v_track RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR v_track IN SELECT streams FROM tracks WHERE artist_id = p_artist_id LOOP
        v_total_streams := v_total_streams + v_track.streams;
    END LOOP;
    RETURN v_total_streams;
END $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This function loops through an artist's tracks to calculate the total streams.

### Function overloading

In PL/pgSQL, function overloading allows you to create multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types or numbers. PostgreSQL automatically selects the appropriate function based on the provided arguments.

Example:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_artist_revenue(p_artist_id INT)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN (SELECT SUM(streams * revenue_per_stream) FROM tracks WHERE artist_id = p_artist_id);
END $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_artist_revenue(p_artist_name TEXT)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN (SELECT SUM(streams * revenue_per_stream) FROM tracks WHERE artist = p_artist_name);
END $$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This example overloads the `get_artist_revenue` function to accept either an artist's ID or name.

## Naming parameters and variables

In PL/pgSQL, using prefixes like `v_` for variables and `p_` for parameters helps distinguish between the two and makes the code more readable. This convention avoids confusion when variables and parameters have similar names, making it clear which are local to the function and which are passed in.

For example:

- `v_total_sales` for a variable holding total sales.
- `p_artist_id` for a function parameter representing an artist's ID.

Other common prefixes include `r_` for records and `c_` for constants.


# Practice

Let's write the function or set of functions that creats the hash from the tree attributes.

For the sake of simplicity we will use the non normalized version of the `treesdb`: `treesdb_v02`

Connect to treesdb_v02 database on your local

- connect to your PostgreSQL server with a PSQL session on your local, and connect to the `treesdb_v02` database
- if the database is not already on your server, restore it from https://github.com/SkatAI/epitadb/blob/master/data/treesdb_v02.01.sql.backup


The goal is to create a sha256 generated hash string for each tree using a concatenation of some of its attributes:  genre, varieties, species, and longitude and latitude (geolocation[0], geolocation[1])

We write a series of functions. Each with a unique task

- concatenate tree attributes
- generate the hash string
- inserts the has string into a new column

## Viewing existing functions

You can view the functions you created and their input types with `\df`

and their definition with `\sf <function_name>`


## concatenation

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION concat_tree_attributes(p_tree_id integer)
RETURNS text AS
$$
DECLARE
    v_concatenated_text text;
    v_genre text;
    v_species text;
    v_variety text;
    v_lon text;
    v_lat text;
BEGIN
    -- Fetch the tree attributes
    SELECT COALESCE(genre, 'UNK'),
           COALESCE(species, 'UNK'),
           COALESCE(variety, 'UNK'),
           COALESCE(CAST(geolocation[0] AS text), 'UNK'),
           COALESCE(CAST(geolocation[1] AS text), 'UNK')
    INTO v_genre, v_species, v_variety, v_lon, v_lat
    FROM public.trees
    WHERE id = p_tree_id;

    -- Concatenate the attributes with '-' and replace spaces with '_'
    v_concatenated_text := CONCAT_WS('-',v_genre, v_species, v_variety, v_lon, v_lat);

    v_concatenated_text := REPLACE(v_concatenated_text , ' ', '_');

    RETURN v_concatenated_text;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

In this function, identify

- the RETURNS data type declaration
- the `$$`
- the declaration of internal variables
- in the select statement, the `INTO`
- how we split the calls to concat and REPLACE over 2 lines instead of chaining them ?

### Test test test and test again

It's important to always test your functions.

At least on a few examples. Take a random `tree_id` and look at the output of the function.

```sql
select concat_tree_attributes(88);
                concat_tree_attributes
-------------------------------------------------------
 Prunus-UNK-Kanzan-2.387247686120145-48.86610339939845
```

ok now the second function. But first let's check that the sha256 extension is installed

## Activate Extension

The sha256 function is part of the `pgcrypto` extension

You can list installed extension with

```sql
\dx
```

On `treesdb_v02` you should just see PL/pgSQl.

```sql
\dx
                 List of installed extensions
  Name   | Version |   Schema   |         Description
---------+---------+------------+------------------------------
 plpgsql | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
```


Activate the `pgcrypto` extension with

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
```

and now it's listed

```sql
\dx
                  List of installed extensions
   Name   | Version |   Schema   |         Description
----------+---------+------------+------------------------------
 pgcrypto | 1.3     | public     | cryptographic functions
 plpgsql  | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
 ```

To list all extensions available for installation

```sql
select * from pg_available_extensions order by name;
```

which returns

```bash
        name        | default_version | installed_version |                  comment
--------------------+-----------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------
 adminpack          | 2.1             | [null]            | administrative functions for PostgreSQL
 amcheck            | 1.3             | [null]            | functions for verifying relation integrity
 autoinc            | 1.0             | [null]            | functions for autoincrementing fields
 bloom              | 1.0             | [null]            | bloom access method - signature file based index
 ...
```

## generate hash

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_sha256_hash(p_input_text text)
RETURNS text AS
$$
DECLARE
    v_hashed_text text;
BEGIN
    -- Generate SHA-256 hash and convert it to a hexadecimal string
    v_hashed_text := encode(digest(p_input_text, 'sha256'), 'hex');

    RETURN v_hashed_text;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;

```

Note

- the name and type of the input parameter
- the data type that is returned

Listing `digest` and `encode` with `\dx`, why do we need to `encode` the output of  `digest`?

### test test test

Your function should return:

```sql
select generate_sha256_hash('hello world');
                       generate_sha256_hash
------------------------------------------------------------------
 b94d27b9934d3e08a52e52d7da7dabfac484efe37a5380ee9088f7ace2efcde9
```


### Create a new column in the trees table


simply done with

```sql
alter table trees add column hash text;
```

### and insert the hash into the column

Given a tree id and its hash, the last function inserts the hash into the corresponding tree
