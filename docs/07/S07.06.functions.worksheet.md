# worksheet on functions

for each tree create a unique hash string

- use existing sha256 function
- concat multiple collumns
- use the concat as input to sha256
- add a column as `sha_id`
- write a simple function that returns the hash given a tree id
- run a several rows
add a constraint that code needs to be unique

- write a pl/pgsql function that runs the sha on all the rows
- insert the sha value in the `sha_id` column
- add check that the tree does not exist already
