# Session 7 : views, functions

## Last time

We saw

- B-tree indexes
  - Tree structure
  - Rules to lower overhead
- Hash indexes
  - Hash functions
- when to use a B-tree or Hash Index :
  - data not entirely random,
  - data not too simple (boolean for instance)
  - operators = (for Hash) or comparison for B-tree
  - used depending on the volume of data returned

## Today

PostgreSQL is not only about tables structure and writing queries but it implements other elements to extend application possibilities.

- **views** : on the fly (in memory or materialized) queries as tables.
- **functions** : writing functions in PL/pgSQL
- **triggers** : modification on a table automatically triggers an action
- **stored procedures** : special functions

We will mostly work on the normalized version of the treesdb on your local.

## Practice

- write a function that assigns a Hash to each record
- write a function that complements the data with calls to an external API

## EOD

You will be able to

- create views
- write PL/pgSQL functions
